# ipp-usb quirks file -- quirks for Pantum devices

# Some Pantum devices (Pantum M7300FDW known to have this bug)
# encode IPP messages improperly.
#
# With this option, ipp-usb will recode IPP responses, so that
# CUPS will accept it.
#
# Note, it still doesn't solve compatibility issues, if device
# is connected over network, not over USB. Either CUPS patch is
# required or user needs to install Pantum proprietary driver

# This device pretends it has a fax, but actually fax unit is missed.
# Attempt to query it's printer-attributes sometimes times out, so
# it is better to disable it.
